  <h1>Where it all began, Hungary</h1>
    <body>
    Dear Thu,
    <br><br>
    You mean the absolute world to me. I hate how you are so far away from me. I am happy that our love is so strong that it reaches me here. I want to start off by saying you make me the happiest human being a live.
 You mentioned before loving each other is like a new type of love that no one can explain, and I think I finally understand it. It resonates into my bones and heart. I have been in love before but no love feels like this. I know fairy tales and Disney movies aren’t real, but I feel like whatever we have is the closest thing to that. I exaggerate this to death but you are my lover, you are my bestfriend and you are my inspiration.
    <br><br>
    You are my lover because I had an immediate attraction on our first date (I literally kissed you on the cheek). You are absolutely stunning, gorgeous and jaw dropping beautiful. I truly think you’re an exotic goddess. I know it’s crazy that you’re Vietnamese and Exotic but you just look so different from a Vietnamese (I think I do too). I know you’re Viet but you also don’t look Viet? Ya know? People think I’m always mixed, that makes me exotic too muahahahha.
    <br><br>
    You are my bestfriend because I can talk to you about anything. I never feel ashamed about bringing anything up to you. We laugh together, play together, work together and it always feels so natural. Living with you was a blast because we have that dynamic of being able to cuddle each other at one moment, to making food and cleaning the house together after, to fucking each other til your cervix bleeds. We are always so cooperative. There are endless examples but my favourite has to be the time in Croatia when we almost missed our bus. I would grab the bags and start searching the near busses, while you spread out to find the buses further away. This brought in so many sensations as we worked as a team and pumped so much adrenaline. This was like a team bonding activity that got me super hot and wanted to fuck you. Another instance that I love was when we went to Disney and you trusted me choosing the rides and the path we were going to take. I know you were scared of the first ride but you ended up having so much fun. Same with Buzz light year, same with every ride. You trusted me to guide you around the park and that I didn’t kill you on any rides. It’s just so good to call you my bestfriend because you’re absolutely fantastic. Quynh Thu Nguyen, you are my bestfriend.
    <br><br>
    You are my inspiration because in my notebook I wrote that visiting you in this time would be almost impossible. You and our love inspired me to do whatever it takes to be with you. As a boss ass bitch, I decided that I would spend Christmas at home with the family and that I needed to spend New years with you. I needed to spend one Holiday with family because I’m obliged and the rest I wanted with you. What better way than to spend NYE and the start of a decade and year with my baby girl. We set the tone right, we set our love life right. This is the start of something new. I love you so much baby girl. I want to be committed to you. With you it seems so easy. You rock my world. You inspire me and satisfy all my wildest dreams. I’m not interested in any other girl but you. You inspire me to be a better man, you inspire me to be more mature and loving and everything.
    <br><br>
    I hope talking to you, reading this, and my constant love will reassure you that I only want you. You are my GURL. I want to keep it that way. You have my utmost love and will continue receiving it. I also don’t want you to feel trapped or hard to breathe, as you have the option to leave whenever. I will warn you that I ain’t a quitter. I will fight for you.
    <br><br>
    I love you to the moon and back x2. <br>
    Be my beautiful moon, while I’ll be your sunshine.
    <br><br>
    Love always,<br>
    Nguyen Kim An Binh
    <br><br>
    P.s I have an idea for something interactive we should do when you’re free after you’re exam.

     <p>
       Hello beautiful, what I'm doing is creating a new method to show you how much you mean to me. Unfortunately Hungarian service is terrible and has lost
       up to 3 of my items already. I really want to send you love and I thought that this would be a creative way to show you. Moving forward, in combination
       with letters being sent, I will also be updating this website with content protruding to my love for you. This will include poems,
       scribbles, pictures I like of you etc.
       <br>
       I hope you enjoy my love.
